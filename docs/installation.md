Stable release
==============

To install platonic, run this command in your terminal:
    
    $ poetry add platonic
    
Or in case you don't have poetry just run:
        
    $ pip install platonic
    

This is the preferred method to install platonic, as it will always
install the most recent stable release.

If you don't have [pip](https://pip.pypa.io) installed, this [Python
installation
guide](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/installation/)
can guide you through the process.

From sources
============

The sources for platonic can be downloaded from the [Github
repo](https://github.com/nekeal/platonic).

You can either clone the public repository:


    $ git clone git://github.com/nekeal/platonic

Once you have a copy of the source, you can install it with:
    
    $ poetry install --no-dev

If you don't have poetry installed:
    
    $ pip install .
